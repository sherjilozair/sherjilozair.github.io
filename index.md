# Sherjil Ozair

I am a research scientist at [Deepmind](https://deepmind.com/).

I graduated from [MILA](https://mila.umontreal.ca/en/){:target="_blank"}, [University of Montreal](http://www.umontreal.ca/en/){:target="_blank"}, advised by [Prof. Yoshua Bengio](http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~bengioy/yoshua_en/index.html){:target="_blank"}.

I'm interested in representation learning, generative models, and model-based reinforcement learning.

In Summer 2018, I interned at [Google Brain](https://research.google.com/teams/brain/){:target="_blank"} with the [Robotics group](https://research.google.com/teams/brain/robotics/){:target="_blank"}.
